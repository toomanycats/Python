The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) is a leading center for simulation and modeling, advanced data-intensive computing and their applications across all disciplines. Working with campus units, NCSA is developing a strong portfolio of interdisciplinary research and education activities through faculty-led research teams of professors, postdocs and students working together with expert NCSA staff to advance the state-of-the-art in research, education and technology. These areas are being developed in themes which address major challenges or opportunities that are complex, multifaceted, and interdisciplinary and require a deep connection to NCSA technologies and expertise.


In the area of Physics and Astronomy, NCSA is the host for the Dark Energy Survey Data Management (DESDM) project and will be the primary archive site for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The astronomy research effort at NCSA and the University of Illinois Department of Astronomy spans a broad range of extragalactic research in theory, computation, and observations, and has strong emphasis on survey data science and synergy of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger studies.


The Physics and Astronomy thematic area at NCSA is seeking a postdoctoral researcher with a primary focus on observational extragalactic astronomy enabled by data science. This position will be primarily resident at NCSA. The successful applicant will be working with Prof. Xin Liu. Liu's group has been working on observational constraints on binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) from kpc scales to sub-pc scales using both survey data and dedicated multi-wavelength observations, as well as detailed studies of host galaxies of obscured quasars.


Key responsibilities
Under the supervision of professor Xin Liu, carry out a program of high quality research using the Dark Energy Survey data to study binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs), quasar host galaxies and AGN feedback processes enabled by data science. Research that leverages the NCSA interdisciplinary culture and advanced cyberinfrastructure environment in data science is encouraged.
Lead the development of peerreviewed research outputs such as publications, data products, software, demonstrations and/or performances and exhibitions.
Give presentations at professional meetings.
Participate in the development of grant proposals.
Required education and experience
Applicants should have received a recent Ph.D. in an appropriate field by the start of the position.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills with a demonstrated ability to communicate results (e.g. via publications, software, visualizations or other methods).
Preferred experience
Experience with developing and/or using advanced cyberinfrastructure relevant to data-intensive survey astronomy science.
This 12/12, 100% postdoctoral researcher appointment will last for two years and may be renewed for a third year contingent upon performance and availability of funding. Salary is competitive and commensurate with experience and relevant research.


Start date: August 15, 2016. (An earlier start date in Spring 2016 may be possible)

At Luxe, members of the Data Science group collaboratively design algorithms to permit the business to scale efficiently. Examples of problems that we are tackling are:
-ETAs
-Dispatch
-Pricing
-Valet staffing
-Customer retention
Each project requires some amount of:
-performing ad hoc analyses to see where opportunities lie
-standardizing definitions of metrics we want to affect
-writing portable Python modules that access and transform our data into these metrics, so that anybody at any time can access these metrics programmatically
-devising and implementing scalable algorithms or models that govern real-time decision making
-composing APIs so that the Engineering department can make use of our algorithms decisions
-running experiments to tune the parameters of each algorithm or model, in order to move our standardized metrics.
Were hiring for the following roles. Whatever role you get hired into at first, there is a good chance that youll be trying on all of the hats over time, depending on our needs and your desires.
Pythonic Data Analyst
A Data Analyst will help build our library of rigorous metrics. Building a metric entails ad hoc exploration followed by standardizing it into an airtight python module. Some metrics will be used in algorithm development, while others will be the basis of charts and graphs for consumption by Product and Operations.
You will:
-have skills in Python and pandas
-have really good SQL skills
-have an academic background in a STEM field
-understand the tenets of building and statistically evaluating models
Pythonic Data Scientist
Data Scientists at Luxe use Machine Learning, Graph Theory, Statistics, Queueing Theory, or whatever other tools they can cobble together to design and implement predictive models (such as ETAs) and optimize algorithms (such as Dispatch and Pricing) that promote our growth and sustainability
You will:
-have an advanced background either in stats, math, engineering, CS, etc
-have good Python skills
-have created models using the ML algorithms in scikit-learn, understanding trade-offs between different algorithms
-be excited for the opportunity to develop algorithms (such as Dispatch, ETAs, Pricing) that can be rigorously evaluated against our metrics
-be expected (at least eventually) to produce APIs so that the Engineering group can interact with our algorithms
Data Architect and/or Pythonic Data Engineer
On one face of the Data Science group is a Redshift database, to which we log lots of data to document our real-time decisions, and from which we read lots of data for historical analysis. On a different face, APIs read the state of the world from, and send decisions to, the Engineering group. We are looking for an Engineer who is well-versed good data architecture practices, and good API design, and who has worked alongside or within a Data Science group before.


Luxe is a fast growing startup that aims to change the way the world thinks about parking, by providing valet parking on-demand. Customers already use our product every day on their mobile phones to get valet parking and additional services (think gas fill-up, car washes, and more) whenever they want it, wherever they want it. With our recent $20M in funding, we are considered one of the hottest startups in Silicon Valley, but were more focused on our mission of bringing our services to the world, one car at a time.
