AT&T; is especially interested in interactive visualization of very large geospatial and temporal data. One example is our open source project Nanocubes ( http://nanocubes.net ).

 Database management and data quality - AT&T; is building high-performance and low latency systems to manage high velocity data streams. These systems are critical for accurate processing and analysis of data from the AT&T; mobile network. Analyzing the data to identify glitches, and cleaning the data to minimize the distortion introduced, are essential to ensure meaningful big data analytics.
