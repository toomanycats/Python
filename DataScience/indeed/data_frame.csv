We are trying to democratize machine learning, and we are looking for the brightest and most talented PMs, data scientists, and engineers to make this possible.

Imagine a world where you can press a button in Excel to forecast sales, add a few lines of JavaScript to your web-site to automatically provide personalized content to your customers, or simply put a smart-chip in a tennis racket that will automatically give tips to improve performance for athletes.


We want machine learning to evolve in a similar way that the camera has. Cameras have evolved from bulky and expensive devices that require fiddling with several knobs to take a great picture, to a device that fits in your pocket and within a split-second captures a great moment. This has enabled us to take billions of photos a day. What if we can do the same with machine learning and use it to power billions of decisions a day? That is what our team is embarking on, and it's not as far-fetched as it seems.


To embark on this vision, we are hiring people to work on the building blocks to make this vision a reality.

Auto-featurization - How can you automatically enrich a dataset with new features so that a data scientist doesn't have to write a bunch of custom featurizers (e.g. if you are doing flight delay prediction can we see that the dataset has time and location fields and offer to join it with weather data)

Growth Hacking Platform - How can we enable external companies to easily try ideas to grow their customer base, test it on small samples, and if it does well deploy to the full customer set. How do we do this in such a way that these companies can even try these in their sales, marketing, and engineering organizations.


While education, skillsets, and experience are important, we feel that the following principles are much more important in high-performance candidates. We look for


Customer Focus - adding value to customers is our north star, so everything we do and build should be focused towards a real customer

Intellectual Curiosity - continually being curious and wanting to learn new things and not being afraid of trying new things

Ability to wear multiple hats - data-science, dev, test, pm, and entrepreneurial skills

Ability to balance a portfolio - creating a balanced portfolio of projects that span low-risk/low-reward to high-risk/high-reward

Impact and passion to move the bottom line - we are looking for people that are really passionate about understanding the higher-level business goals and work towards moving them

Efficient calendar management - ability to manage your calendar/meetings in a way that provides you enough productive blocks of time to be hands-on and solving complex problems.

Execution Efficiency - for any task, there is usually a way to do it 10x faster. We strive on optimizing the job for the need. One might approach a task very differently if they need one significant digit of accuracy versus ten

Failing Fast - over 90% of our ideas fail. We need to understand how to build the right heuristics and tests to fail as fast as possible


We have a similar set of base qualifications for developers, data scientists, and PMs. This is to make sure that we have a high performing team that is deeply technical, and then you can choose the discipline that you best gravitate towards.


The only mandatory requirement is excellent data wrangling or data munging/manipulation skills. Namely, being able to process data from one format to another or the ability to extract specific content from structured or unstructured text (e.g. web-pages).


A strong candidate will also typically have many of the following attributes.

Background in Computer Science, or equivalent technical field

Knowledge of at least one scripting language (e.g. R, python, perl, etc)

Software development skills in one or more high level languages (C#/C/C++/Java/F#)

Experience working with large data sets and working with distributed computing tools (e.g. Cosmos, Hadoop, Spark, Hive, MapReduce, etc)

Knowledge of machine learning and data mining techniques in one or more areas of statistical modeling methods, time series, text mining, optimization, information retrieval.

Ability to prototype statistical analysis and modeling algorithms and apply these algorithms for data driven solutions to problems in new domains.

competitive and business intelligence along with internal data and experience studies to adapt our risk selection approaches
for non-medical requirements. A focus should be on eliminating low protective value requirements and replacing with digital
and structured data to support a scalable business model. Improve modeling and drive a collaborative culture with product
and operations. This role has major responsibility for setting the strategic guidelines ahead of our entrance into all strategic
markets (direct, multi-cultural, middle market, etc.) as well as to recommend strategic initiatives to address distributor and
underwriter pain points. Individual must collaborate with senior leaders from underwriting, actuarial, medical, product,
sales, legal and compliance. This role leads the establishment of underwriting policies, procedures and guidelines including
the cost-benefit justification for all non-medical underwriting requirements required for risk selection. This position has
responsibility for the communication of underwriting policies and guidelines as well as using experience studies and data to
drive guideline changes. Challenge conventional thinking using claim and product experience studies and data as well as
field VOC. Collaborate and cross training with members of the medical team.
 Underwriting Risk & Analytics
As our algorithms continue to feed our big data ecosystem, drive deeper analytics and experience studies (post issue) to


analyze trends and post-issue correlations and causations. Socialize with product and claims areas to improve their
modeling and experience studies, this position should be the key liaison using big data (e.g. early duration claims, early
lapses, ownership changes, advanced analytics, usage of riders and options for cross selling, etc.) so as to better understand
consumer behaviors and grow our business (e.g. DI Future Insurability Option, Term conversions, Waiver of Premium, LTCr
rider). Must be highly analytical with knowledge of product pricing and underwriting, illustrations and risk scoring with the
ability to analyze post-issue data to target key trends and findings to help us improve the protective value of our underwriting
guidelines. With analytics of early duration claims and underwriter quality audits for Life, DI and LTC - formalize a cross
functional team (UW, MD, Product, Ops) to identify any root cause where our standard work and risk selection requirements
could be improved.
 Insurance Risk & Reinsurance Strategy
Partner with Product and Corporate areas to document and articulate our overall risk retention and cession (reinsurance)
strategy. Implications to longevity capacity modeling, business mix, pricing, illustrations are critical focus areas. Further
explore the natural hedge between mortality and longevity risk selection as USIG continues to explore combination products
that package features to meet or exceed consumer expectations.

At Luxe, members of the Data Science group collaboratively design algorithms to permit the business to scale efficiently. Examples of problems that we are tackling are:
-ETAs
-Dispatch
-Pricing
-Valet staffing
-Customer retention
Each project requires some amount of:
-performing ad hoc analyses to see where opportunities lie
-standardizing definitions of metrics we want to affect
-writing portable Python modules that access and transform our data into these metrics, so that anybody at any time can access these metrics programmatically
-devising and implementing scalable algorithms or models that govern real-time decision making
-composing APIs so that the Engineering department can make use of our algorithms decisions
-running experiments to tune the parameters of each algorithm or model, in order to move our standardized metrics.
Were hiring for the following roles. Whatever role you get hired into at first, there is a good chance that youll be trying on all of the hats over time, depending on our needs and your desires.
Pythonic Data Analyst
A Data Analyst will help build our library of rigorous metrics. Building a metric entails ad hoc exploration followed by standardizing it into an airtight python module. Some metrics will be used in algorithm development, while others will be the basis of charts and graphs for consumption by Product and Operations.
You will:
-have skills in Python and pandas
-have really good SQL skills
-have an academic background in a STEM field
-understand the tenets of building and statistically evaluating models
Pythonic Data Scientist
Data Scientists at Luxe use Machine Learning, Graph Theory, Statistics, Queueing Theory, or whatever other tools they can cobble together to design and implement predictive models (such as ETAs) and optimize algorithms (such as Dispatch and Pricing) that promote our growth and sustainability
You will:
-have an advanced background either in stats, math, engineering, CS, etc
-have good Python skills
-have created models using the ML algorithms in scikit-learn, understanding trade-offs between different algorithms
-be excited for the opportunity to develop algorithms (such as Dispatch, ETAs, Pricing) that can be rigorously evaluated against our metrics
-be expected (at least eventually) to produce APIs so that the Engineering group can interact with our algorithms
Data Architect and/or Pythonic Data Engineer
On one face of the Data Science group is a Redshift database, to which we log lots of data to document our real-time decisions, and from which we read lots of data for historical analysis. On a different face, APIs read the state of the world from, and send decisions to, the Engineering group. We are looking for an Engineer who is well-versed good data architecture practices, and good API design, and who has worked alongside or within a Data Science group before.


Luxe is a fast growing startup that aims to change the way the world thinks about parking, by providing valet parking on-demand. Customers already use our product every day on their mobile phones to get valet parking and additional services (think gas fill-up, car washes, and more) whenever they want it, wherever they want it. With our recent $20M in funding, we are considered one of the hottest startups in Silicon Valley, but were more focused on our mission of bringing our services to the world, one car at a time.

Drum roll.we were big data before it was hip  or even a coined term (yes, weve been playing with data for a long time). Better yet, were looking for a Principle/Sr Data Scientist who has worked with big data and wont run away from nearly unsolvable problems. (As an aside, we dont actually say big data here).

To get your attention: we capture approximately 1% of behavioral digital data, meaning this is an intense data environment, providing a stack of challenges even a seasoned Data Scientist wont expect.

THE JOB : To be direct, youll spend time ramping up on our industry and business, along with our proprietary systems. This is never a simple task. Then, youll dive in to listening, deciphering and tinkering with our unsolvables  think of yourself like our Data Therapist. Finally, youll propose, debate, rethink, propose again and implement the best-in-class solutions to increase data accuracy to levels its never seen. And then, youll do it again and again!

ABOUT YOU: You own the fact you have always been intrigued with solving, analyzing problems AND over-thinking almost everything. Weve probably met you at a Data Science meetup, or not, because you were home trying to solve something. You do not run from data challenges, but instead run towards them.

YOU WILL:
Develop our secret sauce  ok - our underlying methodology supporting our data science and data analytics teams by: understanding, proposing and ensuring best data accuracy (this is a big deal).

Create innovative analytics algorithms and methodologies that make huge improvements on our core data assets.

Play nicely with software development to implement data processing pipelines (in an Agile environment).

Interface with multiple teams internally and externally  you WILL be our in-house data science expert.

ITS A MATCH IF:
Experience range of 5-15 years with an Advanced Degree or equivalent (it's really about you)

An uncanny passion to solve complex data challenges using applied stats, machine learning and dev chops. Languages and frameworks such as R, Python, SciPy ,NumPy, Pandas can often create intriguing cube banter, errr, chatter.

You can manipulate data in your dreams in SQL or Bash (if untrue, we imagine you can hop on Coursera quickly).

Experience and confidence to make poorly structured data awesome.

And for the math portion.

Clustering algorithms and segmentation (Latent Class, Factor Analysis)

Machine learning (SVM, Random Forests, etc.)

Predictive modeling & forecasting (Time Series)

Experimental design (Partial Factorial, Randomized Designs)

Multi-attribute optimization (Pareto Optimization) and simulation models

Extra Credit

Experience designing innovative data mining or analytics algorithms to improve signaling, reporting, and panel methodologies. Clickstream data exposure would be great.

Experience with data visualization tools; Tableau is our main squeeze.

In lieu of a cover letter, please answer the following questions so we actually get to know you (cover letters unnecessary):

1. If you could coin a term INSTEAD of big data for your industry, what would it be?

2. What project are you most proud of in your career & what impact did it make on data accuracy? Give as much data as you have time for.
