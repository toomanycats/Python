This is the presentation notebook from my Meetup.
Presenter was another member, Deepthi. She shared her
Kaggle solution and data with us. I've tried out some
ideas with her data in the ipnb file with my initials.

Main additions I made:
instead of using the mean age for missing ages, I
use the  std * normal_dist + mean

I also use word count vectorizer on first and last names,
fit to the survivors, and transform all the names.
Then, to get a single integer for the random forest
ML, I sum all the counts as metric of fit with the survivor
names.
