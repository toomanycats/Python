The file data.csv contains several columns of information. Only columns 1 and 3, called "date" and "car.count",
are relevant here. The data are synthetic.

We would like you to do some initial exploration of these two data columns, fit some simple models,
and summarize what you find. We have in mind this should not take more than about an hour.

We are interested to know what you find, but more importantly how you go about finding it. What process?
What methods? What intuitions did you use to guide your investigation?

If you would like, please make a couple plots or printouts from your exploration to help explain what you
find and how you did it. Please don't spend time making pretty plots, just get it down enough so you can
remember the flow of your exploration so you can explain it to us when we have our phone call. The
conversation we have about what you did and why you did it is more important than the plots and figures
you make.

Please use whatever analysis tool(s) you wish for this project.

A couple questions to answer:

1) Summarize in a qualitative way what you see in the data when you first look it over. What does this
suggest for your "plan of attack" for your analysis? What techniques might be appropriate and useful?

2) How would you characterize your findings quantitatively?

3) What additional analysis might be useful if you had more time to work on the problem?
